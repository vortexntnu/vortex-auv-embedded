# **PWM Generator MCU Documentation**

## **Before you read**
The pwm_generator was originally designed to use the SAMC21E17A (same MCU as the gripper). However, we have since realized that the SAMC21E17A does not have enough distinct PWM channels.
If we in the future decide to use a similar setup a different MCU has to be chosen. For instance a MCU from the SAME5x series will have enough distinct channels. 
This is an import lesson for future embedded teams. Coordinate with electrical to avoid these errors in the future

## **Overview**
The **PWM Generator MCU** is responsible for generating precise PWM signals to control **thrusters**. The MCU receives **duty cycle commands** (in microseconds) from the **Jetson Orin** over **CAN** and converts them into appropriate PWM signals.

This document provides details on **setup, peripherals, communication protocols, CAN IDs, IÂ²C messages, and timer calculations**.

### PWM Pins

#### TCC0 Channels
| Pin  | Timer/Counter | Channel (WO) | Purpose             |
|------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| PA4  | TCC0          | WO[0] (C0)   | PWM output (thruster 1) |
| PA5  | TCC0          | WO[1] (C1)   | PWM output (thruster 2) |
| PA10 | TCC0          | WO[2] (C2)   | PWM output (thruster 3) |
| PA11 | TCC0          | WO[3] (C3)   | PWM output (thruster 4) |


#### TCC1 Channels
| Pin  | Timer/Counter | Channel (WO) | Purpose             |
|------|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| PA6  | TCC1          | WO[0] (C0)   | PWM output (thruster 5) |
| PA7  | TCC1          | WO[1] (C1)   | PWM output (thruster 6) |
| PA8  | TCC1          | WO[2] (C2)   | PWM output (thruster 7) |
| PA9  | TCC1          | WO[3] (C3)   | PWM output (thruster 8) |

> **Note:**  
> PWM channels 2 and 3 are not independent.  
> - Channel 2 mirrors Channel 0â€™s waveform.  
> - Channel 3 mirrors Channel 1â€™s waveform.  
>   
> As a result, this configuration does not provide enough independent PWM outputs for controlling 8 thrusters.


#### TCC2 Channels
| Pin   | Timer/Counter | Channel (WO) | Purpose                 |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| PA16  | TCC2          | WO[0] (C0)   | PWM output (aux 1)      |
| PA17  | TCC2          | WO[1] (C1)   | PWM output (aux 2)      |

> **Note:**  
> TCC2 provides 16-bit resolution, compared to the 24-bit resolution of TCC0 and TCC1.  
> This should not be a significant limitation, since 16-bit resolution is sufficient for our purposes.



#### TC4 Channels (LED PWM)
| Pin   | Timer/Counter | Channel (WO) | Purpose            |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------------|
| PA14  | TC4           | WO[0] (C0)   | PWM for indicator LED 1 |
| PA15  | TC4           | WO[1] (C1)   | PWM for indicator LED 2 |

> **Note:**  
> TC4 can also generate waveform output, but it is not designed specifically for control applications.  
> For control systems, the TCCx peripherals are preferred.  
> However, for tasks such as LED modulation, the simpler TCx peripherals are sufficient.

## **Future Improvements**
ðŸ”¹ **Direct Memory Access (DMA)** â†’ Reducing CPU workload during data transfers.  
ðŸ”¹ **Low Power Mode Implementation** â†’ Optimizing power consumption for extended operation.  
ðŸ”¹ **Enhanced Error Handling** â†’ Improving CAN FD message filtering & IÂ²C communication reliability.  

---

## **Additional Notes**
- The MCU ensures **accurate PWM generation** to maintain **precise thruster control**.
- **DMA and interrupt-based processing** will be added in future firmware updates to **enhance real-time performance**.

The reason the SetPWMThruster function does not use a for loop is to avoid if-statements or multiple for-loops, but 
mostly to accomodate electrical and auto in the order which the pwm values are set
